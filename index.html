        <h2 class="secHead">Adventure Time</h2>
        <p class="text">
          An adventure is an exciting experience or undertaking that is
          typically bold, sometimes risky.
          <br><br>
          Adventures may be activities with danger such as traveling, exploring,
          skydiving, mountain climbing, scuba diving, river rafting, or other
          extreme sports. Adventures are often undertaken to create
          psychological arousal or in order to achieve a greater goal, such as
          the pursuit of knowledge that can only be obtained by such activities.

          <h2 class="desc">BIKING</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="text">
          Biking is a top-notch cardio workout. You’ll burn about 400 calories
          an hour. Plus it strengthens your lower body, including your legs,
          hips, and glutes. If you want a workout that’s gentle on your back,
          hips, knees, and ankles, this is a great choice. <br /><br />You can
          cycle on the road, a bike path, or a mountain trail. Indoors, you can
          do your workout on a stationary bike or buy a stand, called an indoor
          trainer, for your outdoor bike.

          <h2 class="desc">PARA GLIDING</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="text">
          Paragliding is the recreational and competitive adventure sport of
          flying paragliders: lightweight, free-flying, foot-launched glider
          aircraft with no rigid primary structure. <br><br>The pilot sits
          in a harness or lies prone in a cocoon-like 'pod' suspended below a
          fabric wing. Wing shape is maintained by the suspension lines, the
          pressure of air entering vents in the front of the wing, and the
          aerodynamic forces of the air flowing over the outside.

          <h2 class="desc">SURFING</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="text">
          Surfing is a surface water sport in which an individual, a surfer (or
          two in tandem surfing), uses a board to ride on the forward section,
          or face, of a moving wave of water, which usually carries the surfer
          towards the shore.<br><br> Waves suitable for surfing are primarily found on
          ocean shores, but can also be found in standing waves in the open
          ocean, in lakes, in rivers in the form of a tidal bore, or in wave
          pools.
